Meme Share is something of a 9gag clone where users can create, comment, up vote and down vote memes in different categories. 
The project was built using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js (MERN stack). My aim is to continuously add new features and improve the app over time.

Some of the improvements I'd like to add in the future include:

-Notifications when users comment or up vote/ down vote your post

-The ability for users to tag eachother in comments

-Allow users to reply to comments

-Add "popular", "trending" and "new" sections

-Allow users to share posts with friends

If you wish to demo the app you can follow this link: https://affectionate-keller-cf91e8.netlify.app 
You are also able to login with a demo account. The demo account login details are added for you on the login page.
